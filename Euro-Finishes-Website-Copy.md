## HOMEPAGE

### Hero Section
**European Design. Miami Luxury. Since 2007.**

We bring European minimalist principles to Miami's most distinctive homes. No generic luxury. No contractor marketing speak. Just clean lines, exceptional materials, and the kind of restraint that makes a statement.

### The Difference Section
**Why We're Different**

While other contractors chase trends, we've spent 18 years perfecting one approach: European-influenced design that works in Miami's climate and culture. 

We're the team architects call when they need a builder who actually understands design intent. The contractor celebrities choose when they want something that doesn't look like every other "luxury" renovation in South Beach.

Our background in European workshop traditions means we approach every project as craftspeople first, contractors second. The difference shows in details other builders miss.

**What We Actually Do**

We're not a typical contractor. Our European workshop background and 18 years in Miami have taught us that luxury isn't about expensive materials—it's about knowing when less is more.

### Our Approach Section
**How We Work**

**Design-Forward Renovations**  
We don't build generic luxury. Every project starts with understanding your vision, then applying European minimalist principles to create something that works specifically for Miami living.

**Technology Integration**  
Smart home systems that disappear into the design. Climate control, lighting, security, and entertainment seamlessly woven into clean architectural lines. Technology that enhances life without cluttering it.

**Sustainable European Solutions**  
European efficiency meets Miami's climate. Energy-conscious materials, natural cooling strategies, and sustainable systems that reduce environmental impact while maintaining luxury standards.

**Historic Restoration with Modern Sensibilities**  
Coral Gables estates and vintage Miami Beach properties require a delicate touch. We preserve what matters while making these homes work for contemporary life.

**Custom Millwork and Built-Ins**  
Our European workshop heritage means we can create custom elements that integrate seamlessly with your design. No off-the-shelf solutions.

**Complex Problem-Solving**  
Challenging sites, difficult renovations, unique requirements—we've been solving the impossible for 18 years. If other contractors say it can't be done, call us.

**Discrete Service for High-Profile Clients**  
Some projects require extra privacy and professionalism. We understand the unique needs of public figures and high-net-worth individuals.

### Process Section
**Our Process**

**1. Consultation**  
We listen first. Understanding your vision and lifestyle is essential before any design work begins.

**2. Design Development**  
Working with your architect or our design partners, we develop a plan that balances your goals with practical realities.

**3. Principal-Led Construction**  
You work directly with owners who've been doing this since 2007. No project managers, no communication gaps.

**4. White-Glove Delivery**  
We don't consider a project complete until every detail meets our European standards of craftsmanship.
